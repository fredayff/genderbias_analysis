## Introduction

The aim of the present research was to examine the raising concern about potential bias in Black Saber Software's hiring and remuneration process. Based on the fact that workers of the company have complained about the issue of gender bias, the study set out to investigate whether the company's hiring, promotion, and salary processes were all fair. In other words, whether all processes were only based on people's talent and value to the company. Moreover, the study focused on Phase I and Phase II of the hiring process, where the company used AI service to screen applications. The study aimed to determine if the AI process of selecting candidates was fair and without any bias. Furthermore, the data was given based on current employees of the company. Meanwhile, the data was not collected on ethnicity/race.
